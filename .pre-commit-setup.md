# Pre-commit Hook Setup

This repository uses a pre-commit hook to automatically sync the schema version from `config.toml` to `pyproject.toml`.

## Installation

1. Install the `pre-commit` package if you don't have it:
   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   ```

2. Install the git hook scripts:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

## How it works

When you commit changes to `config.toml`, the pre-commit hook automatically:
1. Reads the `schema.version` from `config.toml`
2. Updates all `"default" = "tags/X.Y.Z"` values in `pyproject.toml` to match

## Manual sync

If you need to manually sync without committing, run:
```bash
python scripts/sync_config.py
```

## Disabling the hook temporarily

To commit without running the hook (not recommended):
```bash
git commit --no-verify
```
