Structure and reactivity of the adsorbed layers are largely governed by a critical potential of E = 0.57 V, which determines the onset of Oad formation on the COad saturated surface in the positive-going scan and of Oadreduction in the negative-going scan. Oad formation proceeds via nucleation and 2D growth of high-coverage Oad islands in a surrounding COad phase, and it is connected with COadoxidation at the interface between the two phases. In the negative-going scan, mixed (COad + Oad) phases, most likely a (2 $\times$ 2)-(CO + 2O) and a (2$\times$2)-(2CO + O), are proposed to form at E $<$ 0.57 V by reduction of the Oad-rich islands and CO adsorption into the resulting lower-density Oad structures. CO bulk oxidation rates in the potential range E $>$ 0.57 V are low, but significantly higher than those observed during oxidation of pre-adsorbed CO in the CO-free electrolyte. We relate this to high local COad coverages due to CO adsorption in the CO-saturated electrolyte, which lowers the CO adsorption energy and thus the barrier for COadoxidation during CO bulk oxidation."

Results point out that the effect of the electrolyte on the interfacial water structure is different depending on the nature of the metal alkali cation, with the values of the potential of maximum entropy (pme) following the order pme (Li+) < pme (Na+) < pme (Cs+). In addition, the hydrogen peroxide reduction reaction is studied under these conditions. This reaction is inhibited at low potentials as a consequence of the build up of negative charges on the electrode surface. The potential where this inhibition takes place (Einhibition) follows the same trend as the pme. These results evidence that the activity of an electrocatalytic reaction can depend to great extent on the structure of the interfacial water adlayer and that the latter can be modulated by the nature of the alkali metal cation."

By analyzing the charge density data thermodynamically, the following parameters were determined: the Gibbs excess, Gibbs energy of adsorption, the number of electrons flowing to the interface per one adsorbed iodide ion at a constant electrode potential (electrosorption valency), and at a constant chemical potential. The thermodynamic data for iodide adsorption were compared to the results for bromide and chloride adsorption. All the three halides form a chemisorption bond with the gold surface. The bond is quite polar at the negatively charged surface, however, its polarity drops significantly at the positively charged surface. At low charge densities and coverages, the bond polarity is determined by the ability of free electrons to screen the dipole formed by the adsorbed anion and its image charge in the metal. At high charge densities and coverages, the chemisorption bond has a predominantly covalent character. The strength of the halide adsorption and the covalent character of the chemisorption bond increase progressively by moving from chloride to iodide."

It is demonstrated that the pre-treatment of the electrodes plays a crucial role in determining their electrochemical properties. Scanning tunneling microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry are performed on Cu(1 0 0) electrodes prepared under UHV conditions; it is shown that the electrochemical properties of these atomically well-defined electrodes are distinct from electrodes prepared by other methods. Also highlighted is the significant role of residual oxygen and electrolyte convection in influencing the electrochemical properties."

The electrodes were characterised by cyclic voltammetry and in-situ STM in 0.1 M H2SO4. Preliminary voltammetric results for Pt(110) are also shown. In this case, Cu upd served as a structure sensitive probe. It was observed that the presence of oxygen during cooling induces surface defects and leads to rough surfaces. Cooling in pure N2 preserves the reconstructed Pt(100) and Pt(110) surfaces, while cooling in H2+N2 or CO+N2 lifts the reconstruction. The use of CO as the cooling gas turned out to be advantageous for the preparation of clean and well-ordered (1×1)-surfaces. The stability of reconstructed Pt surfaces in an electrochemical environment is discussed. For H2+N2-cooled Pt electrodes, a clear influence of the H2-concentration on the surface morphology was observed.",
